This site was made is an update to the original revolutionsoft webiste. This serves as a landing page for people who are interested in games that "my company" has published. 

The index now has a carousal of ingame images.
The contact us now has the updated bootstrap input options.
The games page shows the user the games that "my company" has published, a description of each game and a hyperlink to the games' website
Each page now has a navigation bar which allows users to traverse efficently. 


These games weren't made by me and I don't own a company: images were taken from hiclipart.com, pngegg.com, pngitem.com and belongs to the owners and actual publishers of the game.
